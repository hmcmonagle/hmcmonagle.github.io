Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at University of Washington. I'm co-advised by Dr. Tim Essington and Dr. Ray Hilborn, and am a guest student at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 

I'm broadly interested in better understanding the impacts of humans on the marine environment, and in doing science and science communication that informs both conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. For my dissertation, I'm working to describe and quantify the ecosystem services associated with small but abundant fish that live in the twilight zone of the ocean. These ecosystem services include the role that these fish play in moving carbon in to the deep sea (carbon sequestration), and the role they play in moving energy up to higher levels in the marine food web (supporting services). To study these topics, I use a combination of ecological modeling and data collection at sea and in the lab. Other professional interests include communicating science to a broad audience, teaching, and staying up-to-date on high-seas ocean policy and the science used to inform it. Outside of work I love hiking, cross-country skiing, dancing, and spending time with family and friends. 

Linked above are my CV and the websites of the two lab groups I'm a part of at University of Washington. My email and Github page are linked in the icons below. Please feel free to reach out with questions about the research I'm involved in, my code shared on Github, twilight zone fish, applying to grad school or anything else.
